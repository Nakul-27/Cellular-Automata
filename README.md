# Cellular Automata in C

Based off of the livestream by [Tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding) that can be found [here](https://youtu.be/z9y1SDjl0YQ).

A collection of different [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) implementations.

A constant Work in Progress.

## Quick Start
```console
$ make
$ ./rule110
$ ./visualization
```

## Future Work
### This is a section with future work that I'd like to complete at some point.
1. Langton's Ant - I saw this Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant) on Langton's Ant as well as this [simulation](http://www.langtonant.com).
